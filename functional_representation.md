# Functional Representation

1. User manages a private list of suppliers.
2. Product listing form fetches this list and requires one to be selected.
3. Selected vendor id is stored with the product so group participants can see supplier details.
4. PersonalInfoModal allows editing name, phone and address with updates saved on close.
5. Personal info card is merged with the outer profile card and uses a dark theme with green accent. The header above the avatar shows the user's name when loaded. The edit button is icon-only with a pencil and accessible aria-label. A green "See More" bar opens a modal showing phone and address if available.
