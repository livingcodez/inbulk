Instructions for Update:
Create a Feature/Hotfix Branch:


Create a new branch for the assigned task to ensure safe updates without affecting the main build:

 git checkout -b update-feature-branch
Install Dependencies:


Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date:

 npm install
Review any warnings related to deprecated packages (e.g., @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs and others mentioned in the build log).


Work on the Assigned Task:


Implement the necessary changes as per the task. Avoid changes that could potentially disrupt the core functionality or routes like /login, /profile, and /dashboard, etc.


Test the Local Build:


Run the app locally to verify everything works:

 npm run dev
Ensure:


All routes are functional (e.g., /login, /profile, /dashboard).


No runtime errors or warnings.


The app behaves as expected and no existing features are broken.
If any issues arise, review logs for errors and address them promptly.


Ensure Backward Compatibility:


Verify that the app still functions correctly as it did in the last deployment (as seen in the build log). Pay attention to:


Static page generation.


Shared JavaScript chunks.


Middleware and route handling.


Build the Project for Deployment:


Once the task is complete and tested, build the project:

 npm run build
Ensure that the build completes successfully and there are no issues or warnings.


Deploy to Staging (Optional):


If possible, deploy to a staging environment to test in a production-like setting before pushing to the main branch.


Push Changes and Create Pull Request:


Commit your changes and push to the repository:

 git add .
git commit -m "Updated app as per task instructions"
git push origin update-feature-branch
Create a pull request to merge into the appropriate target branch (e.g., dev or main).


Monitor the Deployment:


Wait for feedback from the team responsible for deployment.



Key Notes:
Keep the changes isolated to the task at hand; avoid unnecessary changes to core features.


Use the last build's log as a guide to understand the current app state.


Ensure that deprecated packages or warnings are addressed when adding new dependencies.


Run extensive local testing before creating pull requests.
